# Smart-Dustbin
As a group project for the course Sensors, Instrumentations, and Experimentation, I along with 2 others, made a working prototype of dustbin whose lid opens automatically, without any contact when a person comes near it (in the range of 2 - 30 centimeters) to throw the trash. Few more functionalities were also added in the project as we moved further. This was done with the help of a microcontroller based system where Arduino UNO was interfaced with two ultrasonic sensors and a 9g servo motor.
