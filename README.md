# Smart-Dustbin
As a group project for the course Sensors, Instrumentations, and Experimentation, I along with 2 others, made a working prototype of dustbin whose lid opens automatically, without any contact when a person comes near it (in the range of 2 - 30 centimeters) to throw the trash using a microcontroller based system. Few more functionalities were also added in the project as we moved further. This was done with the help of an Arduino UNO, interfaced with two ultrasonic sensors.
